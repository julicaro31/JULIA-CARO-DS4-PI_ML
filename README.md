# Machine Learning model to predict the price of a property in Colombia

Using data from different properties in Colombia I implement a classification machine learning model to predict wether a property in Colombia is expensive based on the price mean. If the price is less than the mean, the property is categorized as cheap. Otherwise it's categorized as expensive.


The code and the analysis is explained in ***ML_model.ipynb***
